AIO_website_project
===================

New to coding, so I started working on this website (which is my first) to learn the core essence of front-end work.  Thanks to this assignment,
I learned about Twitter Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, some JS components, design, etc.  Though I put this project on hold for a while, the things I have 
learned through it are invaluable.  I inted to finish it soon and FTP to the W3.
