AIO_website_project
===================

New to coding, so I started working on this website (which is my first) to learn the core essence of front-end work.  Thanks to this assignment,
I learned about Twitter Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, some JS components, design, etc.  Though I put this project on hold for a while, the things I have 
learned through it are invaluable.  I inted to finish it soon and FTP to the W3.


Starting on 6 September 2014, I implemented a major redesign.  This is probably like the 3rd or 4th time I do this, but things need to look just right.

This time I am also better organizing css and selectors.
