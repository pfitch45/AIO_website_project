					<h4>About</h4>
					<p>All In One Furniture Assembly was started by Alfonso, our company's original installer. He has over ten years of experience fixing, assembling, and delivering a wide varriety of furniture styles, from modern Scandinavian designs to rustic traditonal Mexican pieces to houses and offices.  
						After working for companies like Macy's, JC Penney, and Ikea, Alfonso noticed that many of his customers needed help with their furniture purchases, so he decided to start All In One to meet his customers' needs.  Alfonso also has worked closely and exclusively with many local area tech office teams.</p>
